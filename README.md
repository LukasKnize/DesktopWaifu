# DesktopWaifu

HI have you ever felt kinda lonely, wondering how everything will be so easy if your favorite waifu was real?

**yeah we all want to find a way to make our dreams come true and bring waifu from our screen to reality**

Unfortunately we still don't have a solution for that, but we now have way to have our waifu with us, all the time, on our desktop thanks to **DesktopWaifu**

As one of my favorite artists once said in his song:
> *"I'd pull her from my screen just like in my dreams
I want to feel her touch..."*
